# Module:        DatasetClass.py
# Description:   Custom PyTorch Dataset class for loading the ImageNet (ILSVRC) dataset from a specific directory structure.
#
# Synopsis:      This class implements a map-style dataset interface (using __init__, 
#                __len__, and __getitem__) to handle the complex hierarchy and 
#                metadata of the ImageNet dataset. It maps WordNet Synset IDs to 
#                integer class labels and generates a list of file paths and 
#                corresponding targets for both training and validation splits.
